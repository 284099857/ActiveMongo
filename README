Really simple ActiveRecord for MongoDB
----------------------------------------

This class is under development, don't use it yet.

What it does now:

- Handle MongoDB connection, conecting once when it is needed
- Define a Collection as a class
- Abstracts iteration over a dataset
- Efficient save() which creates or updates efficiently (ussing $set, $pushAll, $pullAll) a record
- Provides simple queries interface, but allows to get MongoCollection for complex queries in sub-classes

TODO:
    - Add PHPDoc to abstract class 
    - Add delete() method
    - Add support for filtering properties (to ensure data integrity)
    - Add pre and post save Hooks
    - Add efficient support for references to another Record, and an efficient way to load it (with one query if possible)
