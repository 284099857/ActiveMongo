Really simple ActiveRecord for MongoDB
----------------------------------------

MongoDB is a very powerful database, very performant and amicable. I wrote an article about it,

http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/118-Developing-scalable-PHP-applications-using-MongoDB.html

ActiveMongo, is a simple yet efficient MongoDB abstraction, following the ActiveRecord pattern. Visit http://crodas.org/activemongo.php for further details.

What it does now:

- Handle MongoDB connection, conecting once when it is needed
- Define a Collection as a class
- Abstracts iteration over a dataset
- Efficient save() which creates or updates efficiently (using $unset, $set) a record
- Provides simple queries interface, but allows to get MongoCollection for complex queries in sub-classes
- Delete current object, Drop() table
- Support filtering per property
- Support for efficient updates on nested documents
- Support Hooks:
    - pre_save($operation, Array &$document): Right before to perform and insert or update
    - on_save(): When a document is created
    - on_update(): When a document is updated
    - on_iterate(): On iteration, when the cursor moves to the next document
- Support simple yet useful collection installation, useful to create indexes and shard keys.

TODO:
    - Add efficient support for references to another Record, and an efficient way to load it (with one query if possible)
