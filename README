Really simple ActiveRecord for MongoDB

- Define a Collection as a class
- Abstracts iteration over a dataset
- Efficient save() which creates or updates efficiently (ussing $set, $pushAll, $pullAll) a record
- Provides simple queries interface, but allows to get MongoCollection for complex queries

TODO:
    - Added delete() method
    - Add support for filtering properties (to ensure data integrity)
    - Added pre and post save Hooks
    - Added efficient support for references to another Record, and an efficient way to load it (with one query if possible)
