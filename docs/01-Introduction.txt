ActiveMongo 
===========

Introduction
------------

ActiveMongo is a simple active record implementation for MongoDB
and PHP5 (tested on 5.2.11 and 5.3.3).

Some benefits:
 * Everything is an iterable object 
 * Easy to create/update documents
 * Actions, almost every action fires a callback that might modify
   the default behaviour.
 * Support plugins
 * Autoincrements IDs
 * Built-in cache support 


Requirements 
-------------

 * PHP5 (Tested on 5.2.x and 5.3.x)
 * PECL Mongo (>1.0.0)

If the test suite passes in any other version of PHP drop me an e-mail
to crodas@php.net and let me know about it.
